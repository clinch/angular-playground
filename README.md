# AngularJS Playground
==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clinch/angular-playground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clinch/angular-playground)

This is a personal project to play with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and test some of the many features in Angular and ramp up for something more substantial.

A few working examples:

- [AngularJS Todo List](http://clinch.github.io/angular-playground/todo/app/)
- [AngularJS Local Storage](http://clinch.github.io/angular-playground/localStorage/app/)
- [AngularJS Simple Blog](http://clinch.github.io/angular-playground/simpleblog/app/)
